##*project currently suspended*
This is my first approach to Android Studio.

Will be adding and updating the README file along the way

----- Roadmap -----
- first stage  
  [ ] create a first mockup of UI  
  [ ] ask for needed permissions (geolocation, background gps, background activities)  
  [ ] adding 2 or more activities  
- second stage  
  [ ] organize various settings and interfaces    
  [ ] make time alarms work in the background avoiding the process to be killed by the system  
  [ ] link the logic and buttons to make a working mockup  
  [ ] add navbar and fragment views  
  [ ] add secondary functions (repetition of same taks, alarms that triggers only when user is in a specific place in a determined time of the day)  
- third stage
  [ ] use the map view and connect to Google Maps API
  [ ] edit the UI, remove developers buttons and useless links between activities, or sortcuts  
  [ ] add icons
